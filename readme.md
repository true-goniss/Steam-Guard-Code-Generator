using parts of code from SteamAuth by geel9

this app only provides codes to enter steam account. No confirmations here;

if you previously used SDA, you need your login and parameter shared_secret value (from .maFile) without quotes
enter it like:
accountlogin SJHDHJSDH7822HHDSBH
accountlogin2 skfdJADJNSDNjnsDJ243

BE CAREFUL WITH ENCRYPTION. IF YOU FORGET YOUR ENCRYPTION KEY, INFORMATION WILL BE LOST FOREVER.
